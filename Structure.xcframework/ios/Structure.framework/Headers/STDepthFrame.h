 Get the extrinsics relating the iOS camera to the depth sensor.

 The transformation matrix returned here is in the reference frame of the iOS camera. The coordinate frame is right
 handed: X right, Y down, Z out. This matrix can transform a 3D isometry expressed in the Structure Sensor depth stream
 coordinate system to the iOS camera coordinate system using the following operation:

 `3DIsometryInIOSFrame = iOSColorFromDepthExtrinsics * 3DIsometryInDepthFrame`  for row-major matrices
 (pre-multiplication), and `3DIsometryInIOSFrame = 3DIsometryInDepthFrame * iOSColorFromDepthExtrinsics`  for col-major
 matrices (post-multiplication).

 @return a 4x4 GLKMatrix in _column_ major order, with the correct extrinsics for the current sensor and lens
 configuration. This value does not change when streaming registered depth, as it reports the mechanical transform
 between the depth stream and the iOS camera. Will return a matrix of the form [identity rotation | default translation]
 with an approximate calibration. Will return a matrix of the form [nan | nan] with no calibration.
